# Software Preferences

The following is some of my favourite software to have installed / use in a Mac OS environment.

## Utilities

* Automator - Builtin to Mac OS. Task automation.
* Splashtop - Screensharing. Much better than VNC, but is now a monthly subscription... (I got grandfathered in)
* Transmit - Best SFTP client I've found.
* The Unarchiver - Unzip more formats.
* iGetter - Pause/resume file downloads.

## Video

* Screenflick - Screen capture software.
* Final Cut Pro X - Video editing.
* Wirecast - Professional looking livestreams.

# 3D

* Fusion 360 - 3D CAD
* Cinema 4D - Powerful, easy to use 3D modeling software. But actually BodyPaint is the better purchase if you want the cheapest version (same general software).
* Cheetah3D - Like Cinema 4D, but more basic.
* Slic3r - Prepare 3D models for 3D printing.

# 2D

* ToonBoom Harmony - 2D vector/cut-out animation software.
* Affinity Designer - Vector graphics software.
* Eagle CAD - PCB (circuitboard) design.

# Photos

* Pixen - Simple, 2D pixel graphics.
* Hugin - Stitch photos into panoramas. Change projections.

# Audio

* Audacity - Better noise reduction than lots of paid software. Otherwise, I prefer Logic Pro, Garageband etc.

# Software Development

* Sublime Text - Best code editor.
* Unity - Best game engine.
* Android Studio - Develop for Android.
* Xcode - Develop for iOS.
* SourceTree - GIT UI.
* Arduino IDE - Terrible code editor, but works well with Arduino compatible microcontrollers and has a big community.
* Espruino Web IDE - Javascript on microcontrollers?

# Command Line

* Homebrew - Linux style package manager for Mac command line.
* Python - The go to language for machine learning.
* NodeJS - My go to for web servers or any other software without a UI. Or software where a HTML/CSS/Javascript UI is acceptable... which is most software thanks to Electron.
* FFMPEG - Encode video/audio files.
